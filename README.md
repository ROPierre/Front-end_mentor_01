# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

As an oportunity to improve, I've decide to do some challeges from Front-end Mentor. The first one is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj), the first one.

## My process

For the first one I am doing it with only the basics from HTML and CSS using flexbox (maybe some variables to CSS, but I'm still thinking if I am going to do it or not), but I will return to this exercise with Bootstrap 5 and Sass, and maybe React JS. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Responsive-first workflow
