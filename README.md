# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card solution

As an oportunity to improve, I've decide to do some challeges from Front-end Mentor. The first one is a solution to the [Order summary card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj), the first one.

## My process

For the first one I am doing it with only the basics from HTML and CSS using flexbox (maybe some variables to CSS, but I'm still thinking if I am going to do it or not), but I will return to this exercise with Bootstrap 5 and Sass, and maybe React JS. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Responsive-first workflow

### What I learned

I tried to apply some concepts that I usually don't use daily, as variables on my CSS file. I tried to use Classname and Ids more friendly and used flexbox to organize my card. 

Any of this was a surprise, but I realized that doing a design or component without the specifications or the document is kinda hard.

### Useful resources

To help me on this test, I used W3Schools to review some concepts, it is easy to find something with short and precise explanations about what I was looking for.
